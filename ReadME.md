# Git & GitHub Basics Project
## Project Overview

This project was created to understand the basic workflow of Git and GitHub, including version control, staging changes, committing, and pushing updates to a remote repository.

The project demonstrates how code changes are tracked over time using Git.

## Objectives

Understand how Git tracks files

Practice staging and committing changes

Push code to a GitHub repository

Observe how updates reflect after modifying code

## What Was Done

I created a simple Java class

Initialized a Git repository

Added the class to Git tracking

Committed the initial version

Pushed the project to GitHub

Made a change to the class

Committed and pushed the update to GitHub

## GIT Operations Learned

git init

git status

git add .

git commit -m "commit message"

git commit -m "first commit"

git branch -M main

git remote add origin https://github.com/ayobamiadepoju/JUG-PROJECT.git

git push -u origin main

Tracking file changes

Updating a remote repository

## Conclusion

This project serves as a simple hands-on introduction to Git and GitHub, showing how developers manage code versions and collaborate effectively.
